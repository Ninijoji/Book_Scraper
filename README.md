# Book_Scraper
This code scrapes book data from a website and saves it to a CSV file. It uses BeautifulSoup for HTML parsing. The scrape_book_data function retrieves book names, prices, and image URLs from a given page. The scrape_multiple_pages function scrapes multiple pages, adding a delay between requests. The main code sets parameters, calls the functions, and writes the data to a CSV file.

It's a flexible script for scraping and organizing book data from websites.
